# Liam's Workspace

### This page is used to demonstrate some of my work, and introduce with some of the projects I worked with for my previous position.

Created using React.js

---

## Partfolio Design
---

### Explanation

* To learn and practice with React, I chose to use React to create this portfolio.
* This will be a static SPA with no backend.
* Bootstrap will be used to make this portfolio looks nicer.
* Home page will be some general information about myself, or another word, my resume. The home page will also provide an index for all the different projects.
* There will not be page to demonstrate projects directly since there's no project maintained. There will be only introducing some of the structures, or function explanation.
* For the projects I worked with in my previous job, since I have no right to leak the code, I will only explain some of the features.

### Design & Structure

* **Homepage**: With an index which leads to pages to show some of the main projects I created.
* **Header**: Has some buttons for navigation, includes [ *Main Page*, *About*, *Contact Me* ]
* **Project Page**: Has at least one picture, followed by a brief explanation, such as technology stacks used. Public projects will provide the link(s) to the repository.
* **About Page**: Will provide development diary, and all the source, including readme + github repo.

### Source Control & Workflow

* Since this is a personal project, I will commit most onto the master branch, unless bumping onto some major bug.
* Due to the design I have got now is too simple, Agile will not be used (it is too strict for one-person-team as well), Extreme Programming methodology will be used for me to create this project. A new task will be created and finished (I suppose) on a daily bases.
